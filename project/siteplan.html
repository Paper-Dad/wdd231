        <h1>Team Avatar</h1>
        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p>I chose the name Team Avatar because fans of the show will recognize this name.
            In the show, the group of friends that travel together with the main character call themselvs
            Team Avatar. I believe this name will attract fans of the show.
        </p>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The site provides a fun and informative area for people who love the show "Avatar: The Last Airbender"
            True fans are always looking for more ways to experience the show they love and this website will
            provide them with additional content.
        </p>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>What nation would belong to in the Avatar Universe?</p>
        <p>Where can I go to get more Avatar Content?</p>
        <p>What Episode should I watch next?</p>
        <p>Where can I learn more about the characters</p>
        <h2>Color Schema</h2>
        <p>The colors of this website will be simple but epic. They will represent Aang when he enters the Avatar state.
            They will be black (#000000), white (#ffffff) and neon light blue (#6ee8f9).
        </p>
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>The fonts I have chosen are Permanent Maker and Roboto.</p>
        <p class="marker">Permanent Marker</p>
        <p class="robot">Roboto</p>
        <p>I have picked Permanent Marker as the font of all the titles and headings. The font is similar
            to the font of the title card from the show. I hope to attract fans of the show with a fun and familiar
            font.
            I have picked Roboto to be the regualr text of the web page. I chose this font because it is clean and easy
            to read. I believe this will allow the user to be able to read my webpage with minimal difficulty.
